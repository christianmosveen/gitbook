# Rebase
Detach a branch and reattach it at the tip of another branch

```
git rebase <branch>
git rebase -i <branch>
```

#### Assignments
1. Branch out, create a commit and merge the branch back. Then branch out again, create a commit and rebase the branch back onto the original one. Observe the difference in how the commit graph looks.
2. Branch out, create three small commits, and do an interactive rebase back onto the original branch. Get familiar with the interactive rebase commands, and try a couple of different ones.
